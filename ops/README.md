# ops/

Deployment artifacts for the production VPS. Files here are **verbatim copies of
what runs in production** — not templates. Change the copy here first, then
re-install it on the box, so the two never drift.

`deploy.sh` installs to `/usr/local/bin` rather than running from the repo
checkout so that a `git pull` cannot rewrite the script while it is executing.
Since stage 1 it **self-installs** that copy (plus the `/usr/local/lib/pareton-ops`
programs) from the just-pulled commit on every successful deploy, helpers first
and the main entry last. The one-time manual bootstrap that installs the first
self-updating copy is in [`runbook.md`](runbook.md).

## A merge to `main` is a production deploy

`pareton-deploy.timer` polls `origin/main` every 60 seconds. There is no
separate promote step. Every tick that holds the deploy lock first runs the
stage-1 config sync (`sync-config.py deploy-hook`): managed-file drift
converges to the Git content automatically, while unknown files, masks, or a
broken alert credential fail the deploy and page the team. Any merge then
restarts `pareton-api`, `pareton-watcher`, and `pareton-weights` within a
minute. Each execution worker has its own pending
restart. The round worker waits only for running rounds; the existing worker checks
both queues to protect legacy combined processes. A busy build does not defer an
idle round worker's update. A deploy that fails — including a failing worker
busy-probe — triggers `OnFailure=pareton-deploy-failed.service`, which sends a
rate-limited alert straight to the team Discord channel (independent of
Vector/Axiom).

**During a maintenance window, stop this timer first.** Stopping any other unit
while the timer is live means the timer may restart it underneath you. Stopping
the timer does not stop a deploy that is already running — wait for it, then
work. After a manual hotfix to a managed file, the fix must be **merged to
`main`** (a pushed branch or open PR is not enough) before the timer is
resumed, or the next tick reverts the live change as drift.

### Worker heartbeat alerts

After both services are shipping logs, filter the existing Axiom
`worker-heartbeat-absent` monitor to `pareton-worker.service`, then clone it as
`round-worker-heartbeat-absent` with the second query below. Keep the current
notifiers and evaluation frequency, use **Below 1 over 15 minutes**, and enable
**Alert on no data** for each. The existing `_SYSTEMD_UNIT` field identifies the
process, so the heartbeat payload does not need changing.

```apl
['pareton-prod']
| where event == "heartbeat" and _SYSTEMD_UNIT == "pareton-worker.service"
| summarize count()
```

```apl
['pareton-prod']
| where event == "heartbeat" and _SYSTEMD_UNIT == "pareton-round-worker.service"
| summarize count()
```

Use two fixed filters: a grouped query can lose a missing service's group while
the other continues reporting. These alerts detect absent processes or telemetry;
progress stalls still require round phase/heartbeat monitoring. Adding weights
to the allowlist resumes its telemetry on the next scheduled event, without
forcing a weight submission or recovering previously discarded logs.

**During a maintenance window, stop this timer first.** Stopping any other unit
while the timer is live means the timer may restart it underneath you.

## Known drift — needs a decision

Resolved on 2026-09-10 by the stage-1 capture (files here now mirror the live
box, verified against the read-only audit output of that day):

1. ~~`pareton-worker.service` differs from the live unit~~ — the committed file
   is now the captured live version; the queue split lives in the
   `queue.conf` drop-in (also captured).
2. ~~`TimeoutStopSec` drop-in drift~~ — `timeout.conf` (4h) is committed next
   to the unit; the effective value stays 4h. Revisit the value itself later.
4. ~~`vector.toml` inline token~~ — the repo keeps the `${PARETON_AXIOM_TOKEN}`
   form; the owner verified the env token via a direct ingest test, so the
   live file migrates to the env reference at the stage-1 bootstrap and new
   events arriving in `pareton-prod` are the acceptance evidence
   (`vector validate` passing proves nothing about token validity).

Still open, each because it changes production behavior:

3. **`aws/pareton-api-iam-policy.json` overstates the live IAM policy.** It
   grants `s3:ListBucket` and `s3:DeleteObject`; the live `pareton-api` user
   has neither. Only `PutObject`/`GetObject` on `stage0/*` actually work.
   Private patch uploads, validator reads, and public copies require only
   `PutObject`/`GetObject`. The file should not be treated as an accurate record
   of live permissions.

5. **The box needs swap, and nothing here says so.** Hermetic builds compile
   vLLM's CUDA kernels; `cicc` peaks at 6–12 GB per job and will OOM a 16 GB
   box. The only record of this is a comment in `a2b-build.sh` telling you to
   `fallocate` a 64 G swapfile by hand. A host rebuilt from this directory
   silently gets no swap, and the first submission dies with `Killed` /
   `exit status 137` — which surfaces as `hermetic_build_failed` and rejects
   the miner's patch for an infrastructure fault. `pareton-prod-02` now has a
   64 G swapfile with an `/etc/fstab` entry; provisioning should create one.

## Reinstalling a unit

```sh
scp ops/systemd/pareton-deploy.timer root@<host>:/etc/systemd/system/
ssh root@<host> systemctl daemon-reload
ssh root@<host> systemctl restart pareton-deploy.timer
```

## Builder disk cleanup

The persistent build host keeps local retention tags for the build-base and
baseline engine images of every draft or open campaign. Published candidate
tags are removed after their digest-pinned reference is stored in Postgres.
The hourly fallback sweep removes leftover candidate tags and prunes ordinary
BuildKit records after Docker storage crosses 75% usage. It targets the same
explicit Buildx builder as miner builds and does not run daemon-wide image or
system prune commands.
BuildKit `exec.cachemount` records are excluded because they hold the warmed
baseline ccache used by later miner builds.

Docker Engine's background BuildKit GC is disabled on the dedicated builder
host. Pareton's filtered cleanup is the only BuildKit GC authority, so Docker
cannot independently reclaim `exec.cachemount`. Both the worker and cleanup
units fail their startup check unless `/etc/docker/daemon.json` has
`builder.gc.enabled=false`.

Baseline build and serving images for every draft or open campaign have local
retention tags. Candidate and leader images are durable in GHCR by digest.
Rounds read those digest-pinned references from Postgres and pull them on the
GPU host, so removing a builder-host candidate tag never causes a rebuild.
This cleanup never deletes registry artifacts.

The cleanup fails without deleting anything when Postgres is unavailable, and
skips a run when a build holds the shared storage lock. Preview it before
installing the timer:

```sh
cd /opt/pareton
set -a
. ./.env
set +a
.venv/bin/python -m builder.cleanup --dry-run --force
```

Install the Docker policy and both units during a maintenance window. The
committed file is a merge fragment, not a replacement daemon configuration.
It deliberately omits `features.containerd-snapshotter`. Merge it into the
host's current configuration so Docker keeps its active classic or containerd
image store and every unrelated daemon setting. Record the active storage
driver before the restart and require the same value afterward.

```sh
systemctl stop pareton-deploy.timer
systemctl stop pareton-worker
command -v jq
test -f /etc/docker/daemon.json
image_store_before=$(docker info --format '{{json .DriverStatus}}')
cp -a /etc/docker/daemon.json /etc/docker/daemon.json.pre-pareton-gc
daemon_merged=$(mktemp)
jq -s '.[0] * .[1]' \
  /etc/docker/daemon.json ops/docker/daemon.json > "$daemon_merged"
dockerd --validate --config-file="$daemon_merged"
install -m 0644 "$daemon_merged" /etc/docker/daemon.json
rm -f "$daemon_merged"
systemctl restart docker
image_store_after=$(docker info --format '{{json .DriverStatus}}')
test "$image_store_after" = "$image_store_before"
.venv/bin/python -m builder.gc_config
cp ops/systemd/pareton-worker.service /etc/systemd/system/
cp ops/systemd/pareton-builder-cleanup.service /etc/systemd/system/
cp ops/systemd/pareton-builder-cleanup.timer /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start pareton-worker
systemctl enable --now pareton-builder-cleanup.timer
systemctl start pareton-builder-cleanup.service
systemctl start pareton-deploy.timer
journalctl -u pareton-builder-cleanup.service -n 100 --no-pager
```
